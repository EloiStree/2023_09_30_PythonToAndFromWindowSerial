> Be able to broadcast in UDP read input of the Serial Port and send string value to the Serial port through UDP.

I wanted to do this code in C# with in Unity. But it seem to be more easy and robuste to time to do it in Python.

The tool must have two option.

First is to be able to observer/listen to a port com based on the name or the a description regex.
And broadcast to UDP targets what ever is read as char or Text.


The second feature is the ability to push Text, byte or char  from a UDP port gate  to present serial port of the machine.
